# Accuracy-Weighted Cross-Entropy Loss for Classification

I explored a loss function where correct and incorrect predictions have their loss magnitude multiplied by significance. As loss is somewhat analagous to the inverse of reward in reinforcement learning, adjusting its impact based on accuracy, a crucial metric, is pivotal. The observed improvements in results are minimal; however, further refinement or extensive testing may yield more substantial outcomes.

Note: Initially termed "Loss Smoothing," inspired by Label Smoothing, this case does not aim to smooth the loss function.
